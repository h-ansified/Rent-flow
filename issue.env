this - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 405




Reasoned
A 405 response means the URL was reached but the HTTP method your app used (e.g., POST, PUT, GET) is not allowed by that endpoint. Common causes with Supabase setups:

You called an Edge Function with the wrong HTTP method (e.g., POST to a function that only handles GET).
You hit a Supabase REST endpoint (PostgREST) or custom server route with the wrong method.
You're sending a browser preflight (OPTIONS) that the server doesn't accept due to missing CORS handling.
You are POSTing to a static file URL or wrong path.
What I need from you to give the exact fix

The failing request details from DevTools → Network:

Request URL
Request Method (e.g., POST)
Response headers (at least Content-Type and any Allow header)
Response body (if any)
Tell me which of these you're calling:

A Supabase Edge Function (custom code)
supabase-js .from('table').insert(...) (client insert)
Supabase REST (PostgREST) endpoint
Your own server/webhook URL
Quick checks and immediate fixes you can try now

If calling an Edge Function: ensure the function handles that HTTP method. Example: if you POST, your function must accept POST in Deno. If it only handles GET, change it to handle POST or change your client to GET.
If calling PostgREST via supabase-js: use supabase.from('table').insert(...) instead of calling /rest/v1/table directly, or ensure you're using the correct HTTP method (POST for insert).
If you see an Allow header in the response (e.g., Allow: GET, HEAD), change your method to one of the allowed ones or update server to accept your method.
If CORS/OPTIONS is the issue: check whether the response to OPTIONS is 405. You may need to enable CORS or configure the server to reply properly for OPTIONS. For Edge Functions, add handling for OPTIONS and correct Access-Control-Allow-* headers.*
If you paste the Network details (URL + Method + response headers/body), I will give the exact code change or SQL you need — for example:

Edge Function: exact minimal Deno code to accept POST and return CORS headers.
supabase-js: correct client call to insert.
PostgREST: correct endpoint and method.
Paste the request URL and method (copy from DevTools). I'll respond with the precise fix.
